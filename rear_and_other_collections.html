              of Rare Books Division to its new premises on Bhasha Bhavan Basement, National Library Kolkata from 1st

            <h3 class="text-secondary">Science and Technology Collection</h3>
            <p>It is important to note that three committees in their reports “unanimously recommended the need of
              setting up of a well balanced science library in the National Library, Calcutta. The Science and
              Technology Division of the National Library were set up in April, 1972 in the ground floor of the Annexe
              Reading Room in accordance with the recommendation of the reviewing committee as well as of the Kamath
              committee. The committee of management headed by Prof. Niharranjan Ray as the Chairman was formed by the
              Government of India in October 1975 to advice the Department of Culture and the Acting librarian of the
              National Library regarding the functioning of the Library. This committee reviewed the acquisition policy
              of the of the library in the areas of science and technology and suggested that “since the National
              Library was not a specialized library, the library should not acquire highly specialized books in any
              branch of science and technology, which were being acquired by various other institutions but should
              concentrates on the following areas:</p>
            <!-- <p>Current collection includes:</p> -->
